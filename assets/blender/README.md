# Blender models
All Blender models for ProjectP should be stored here. You may only use Blender for modelling.
You may only structure the models in themed folders in lowercase [kebap-case](https://www.theserverside.com/definition/Kebab-case).
> **Example:**
> A fleet spaceship model
>
> could be stored in the directory `./spaceships/fleet-ships`
